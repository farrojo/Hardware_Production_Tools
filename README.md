# Hardware Production Tools

This repository has specific tools, that I used for some money, to make a quick flash in an electronic equipment production plant. To speed up the process, the objective was always to prevent operators from interacting through clicks with the chip manufacturers' tools, for which, and based on the documentation of each manufacturer, several sets of interactions were connected to control scripts, which were responsible for its cyclical execution, allowing the operations to carry out a more agile process.

In this repository, at an example level, simple scripting tools are found for families of Atmel microcontrollers and Xilinx FPGAs and GALs.
